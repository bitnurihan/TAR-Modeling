# TAR-Predictive Modeling

1. Purpose
- Developed predictive modeling for 'grp' and 'reach%' based on raw data, and proceed with optimal cost allocation by screen to acheive the highest reach% based on total advertising costs.


2. Description of python file
 - modeling_by_python.py
 : extracts modeling constants and slop from raw data.
 - compare_r_py_modeling.py
 : compares R modeling constants with Python modeling constants to verify which coefficients are better representative of the actual raw data.
 - cost_optimization.py
 : Budget allocation for each screen to maximize the advertising effect(reach%) within the same budget.
 - modeling_visualization.py
 : compared raw data and modeling curves with determined coefficients and constants before client review.
